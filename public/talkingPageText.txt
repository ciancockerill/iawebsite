Walking into the room on day one, I was instantly met with a sense of small community. Talking, discussion, and feedback were immediately made important, almost forming the core of the module itself.

Icebreakers, while admittedly rough to get through, helped me laugh, talk, and familiarize myself with my classmates and the module coordinators. These early moments were crucial in building a comfortable atmosphere where communication flowed more freely.

The core mission of the Innovation Academy is to provide a transformational educational experience for the betterment of society, the economy, and the planet. This mission was apparent from the start and aligned with the values we are encouraged to embody.

We were introduced to the concept of transversal skills, which are defined as “skills that are not specifically related to a particular job, task, academic discipline, or area of knowledge but can be applied in a wide variety of situations and work settings.” In today's world, transferable skills are nearly as important as core skills. They help us adapt to the ever-changing landscape around us. For me, going into the tech industry where things evolve daily, this emphasis on adaptability feels incredibly relevant.

Each time I walked out of the classroom, I found myself asking what I wanted to develop within myself. What weaknesses can I improve on? These questions have become a central focus of my journey in this module, driving my personal growth alongside the technical skills I’m gaining.
