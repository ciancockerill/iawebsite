In the customer relations room, we were tasked with developing a public image to suit our target audience. Similar to the peer group, our group found that the people presented weren’t a wide enough range; there were no casual riders, no varying levels of fitness, and difficulty. We also noticed that the logos and advertisements were way too narrow, featuring obscure or experimental designs when we thought more minimalistic logos would have suited better.

During our tasks, we discussed subtle communication and discovered that everything can be used to present yourself—tone of voice, eye contact, physical appearance, and more. It’s really important in any setting to be able to present yourself effectively.

We also talked about how the same techniques could be used to represent a brand—considering the tone of advertisement, music, visuals, and slogans.

Moving forward, I’ll be looking out for these elements in my everyday interactions and how they relate to transversal skills. I want to focus on improving my ability to communicate effectively and present myself in various situations, recognizing that these skills are not only essential for personal growth but also for my future in the tech industry.
