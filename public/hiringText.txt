In this room, we were tasked with finding our next Innovation Officer by reviewing CVs and identifying pros and cons. The main issue we found was that the CVs weren’t tailored to the job; many included useless information and didn’t expand on the candidates' skills to effectively advertise themselves.

We then watched two interview videos of candidates who made it through the CV sifting process. Candidate 1 immediately stood out with strong eye contact and a lack of “umms” and “ehhs.” They presented their experiences in a way that truly advertised themselves for the position. In contrast, Candidate 2, although she had better experience on paper, failed to elaborate on her time in a similar role and, in my opinion, fell short.

As a team, we had to document our own innovative hiring process. We came up with a method that included a phone interview for a personality check, followed by a group interview where candidates could share their ideas. Finally, we proposed an in-depth interview where the selected candidate could detail how they’d implement their ideas. This approach assessed their communication skills, quick thinking, and ability to work with compromise, along with a traditional stage where they could really showcase themselves.

Moving forward, I’ll be more aware of how I present my own skills and experiences, both in written forms like CVs and during interviews. I plan to focus on tailoring my communication to effectively highlight my strengths.
