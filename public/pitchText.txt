In the last room, we were tasked with coming up with a pitch for our bike company. Within our team, we presented an electric bike company with a tracking and personalization app, allowing users to rent bikes by the minute, similar to Bolt bikes. This concept aimed to provide a convenient and eco-friendly transportation option for busy city dwellers.

When it came time to pitch ourselves to investors who had interests in various areas, we quickly learned the importance of finding compromises. We realized that we needed to focus on 2 or 3 key points that resonated with the investors instead of spreading ourselves too thin trying to please everyone. This taught us to hone in on our strengths and communicate them effectively.

We also discovered that storytelling is a powerful tool in pitches. By framing our product within a relatable narrative, we could engage the investors on a personal level, showcasing not just the features of our bikes and app but also the lifestyle they represent. This made our pitch much more compelling.

Moving forward, Iâ€™ll be more mindful of how I present ideas and products. I want to focus on understanding my audience and what matters to them. Developing my ability to tell a clear and engaging story around my ideas will be essential, especially as I navigate collaborative settings and align with different stakeholders' interests. This experience reinforced how crucial it is to communicate effectively and make meaningful connections.
