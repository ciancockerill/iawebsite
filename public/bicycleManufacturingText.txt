Within the bike manufacturer room, we were presented with a peer group. The peer group was small and didn’t cover a wide range of the potential customer base. We used this information to choose a bicycle. While it was easy to pick a bike to suit them, I felt it was lacking representation for more casual riders, varying levels of fitness, commute time, and other factors.

Peer groups and interviews are so important for determining what type of product to sell. Will the investment give a return on investment? Does it target the majority of the population? These questions are crucial in the decision-making process.

Outside of the VR room, our afternoon task focused mainly on the quality of the focus group. We were tasked with designing questions to help people open up more, which is highly important in any situation—work meetings, discussions with friends, interviews, etc. We were also asked to design questions for interviews about someone's strengths. We chose a question like, “What role do you see yourself playing in our team?” because it encourages the person to reflect on their contributions and how they fit into the team, which leads to a deeper understanding of their strengths.
